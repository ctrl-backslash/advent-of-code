# Advent of Code 2024

After setting up your `uv` virtualenv, you can run `uv sync`. Then you can run the following:

```
python main.py dec_<DAY> <PART#> <PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE.txt>
```

Example:

```
python main.py dec_6 2 input.txt
```

This uses [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/).

The code in the repository may not have the best runtime. The code was optimized to take less time to write.
